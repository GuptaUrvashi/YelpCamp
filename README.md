 # How it works:
 
This is a YelpCamp website, where you can add Campgrounds and write comments. The index page takes you to a grid format to see all campgrounds available. To read about more information regarding a particular campground, you can hit the button READ MORE. This takes you to a new page, where you can write a comment about this campground. 

Also, middleware and authentication is added so you can sign up or login to be allowed to use other features. Once logged in, you will be able to edit or delete only the comments created by you and not others. You can add a campground and the author information is extracted automatically from your login id. 

Furthur, all this information is stored in Mongo Database hosted from Mongo Labs and server used to run the application is Heroku.
